            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Kings</hi> Majesties Message brought by Captaine <hi>Titus</hi> to the Parliament on Munday, <hi>October</hi> 2. 1648.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Majesty did use many earnest endeavours for a Personall Treaty, which He hoped might have been obtained at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, between Him and His two Houses of Parliament immediately; yet they having made choice of this way by you their Commissioners, His Majesty did gladly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept thereof in this place, as a fit meanes to begin a Treaty for Peace, which might put an end to his owne sad condition, and the miseries of His Kingdome; For an entrance whereunto. His Majesty hath already expressed His consent to the first Proposition: But finding you are limited by Instructions which you have no Warrant to Communicate unto Him, And having cause by your Papers of the 20 of this present to beleeve, that you have no power to omit or alter any thing, though He shall give you such reasons as may satisfie you so to doe, without transmitting the Papers to the two Houses at a far distance, where His Majesties reasons, expressions, and offers upon Debate cannot be fully represented; and from whence their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers cannot be returned without much waste of the time allotted for the Treaty heere: And having lately received another Paper concerning the Church, containing in it selfe many particulars of great importance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to divers Ordinances; Articles of Religion, and other things (11 or 12 in number) of great length, and some of them very new, and never before presented to his Majesty: The due consideration whereof will take up much time, and require His Majesties presence with his two Houses before a full resolution can well be had in matters of so high consequence; To the end therefore that the good worke now in hand may (by Gods blessing) proceed more speedily and effectually to an happy Conclusion; And that His two Houses of Parliament may at present have further security, and an earnest of future satisfaction: His Majesty upon Consideration had of yours, makes these Propositions following:</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Concerning the Church.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HIS Majesty will consent that the calling and sitting of the Assembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at Westminster be confirmed for Three yeares by Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And will by Act of Parliament confirme for Three yeares the Directory for the publique worship of God in the Kingdomes of England and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116871:3"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And will likewise confirme for Three yeares by Act of Parliament the forme of Church Government, which yee have presented to Him, to be used for the Churches of England and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales; Provided, that His Majesty, and those of His judgement, or any other who cannot in Conscience submit thereunto, be not in the meane time obliged to comply with the same government or forme of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but have free practice of their owne profession. And that a free Consultation and debate be had with the Assembly of Divines of Westminster in the meane time, (20 of His Majesties nomination being added unto them) whereby it may be determined by His Majesty and His two Houses of Parliament how the said Church-Government and forme of publique Worship after the said time may be settled, or sooner, if diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencs may be agreed. And how also Reformation of Religion may be settled within the Kingdomes of England and Ireland, and Dominion of Wales. And the Articles of Christian Religion now delivered to Him may in like manner be then considered of and determined, and care taken for the ease of tender consciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And concerning the Bishops Lands and Revenues, His Majesty considering that during the troublesome times divers of His Subjects have made contracts and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and divers have disbursed great sums of monies upon security and engagement of those Lands; His Maje<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ty for their satisfaction, will consent to an Act or Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereby legall Estates for Lives or for Yeares (at their choice) not exceeding 90 yeares shall be made of those Lands towards the satisfaction of the said Purchasers Contractors, and others to whom they are ingaged, at the old Rents, or some other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Rent, whereby they may receive satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in case such Lease shall not satisfie, His Majesty will propound and consent to some other way, for their further satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provided, that the propriety and inheritance of those Lands may still remaine and continue to the Church and Church-men respectively according to the pious intentions of the Doners and Founders thereof: And the rest that shall be reserved to be for their maintenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Majesty will give His Royall Assent for the better observation of the Lords day; For suppressing of Innovation, in Churches and Chappels, in and about the Worship of God, and for the better advancement of the Preaching of Gods holy Word in all parts of the Kingdome. And to an Act against enjoying Pluralities of Benefices by Spirituall persons, and Nonresidency. And to an Act for regulating and reforming both ∆≤niversities, and the Colledges of Westminster, Winchester, and Eaton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Majesty will Consent to an Act for the better discovery and speedy conviction of Popish Recusants, as is desired in your Propositions; And also to an Act for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Children of Papists by Protestants in the Protestant Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As also to an Act for the true levying of the penalties against Papists, to be levied and disposed in such manner as both Houses shall agree on, and as is proposed on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties behalfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And also to an Act to prevent the practises of Papists against the State. And for

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as to the Covenant, His Majesty is not yet therein satisfied that He can either signe or sweare it, or consent to impose it on the Consciences of others. Nor doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it proper or usefull at this time to be insisted on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Touching the Militia, His Majesty conceives that your Proposition demands a far larger power over the Persons and Estates of His Subjects, then hath ever hitherto been warranted by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme; yet considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent distractions require more, and trusting in His two Houses of Parliament that they will make no further use of the power therein mentioned, after the present distempers setled, then shall be agreeable to the legal exercise thereof in times past, or just necessity shall require, His Majesty will consent to an Act of Parliament.</hi>
